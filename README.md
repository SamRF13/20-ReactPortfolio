This is my portfolio. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My portfolio is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my portfolio is useless. Without my portfolio, I am useless. 

My portfolio is human, even as I , because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its contents. I will keep my portfolio clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other.
